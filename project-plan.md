## 4. Basic Workflow

1. **Business Owner Onboarding:**

2. **Client Appointment Booking:**
   - Client visits business booking page
   - Selects service
   - Views available time slots based on service duration and business hours
   - Selects time slot and enters contact information
   - Receives confirmation email

3. **Appointment Management:**
   - Business owner receives notification of new booking
   - Can approve or reschedule
   - Calendar updates to show the booked time slot
   - Reminder emails sent to clients before appointment
   - Business can mark appointments as completed

## 5. Frontend Technical Considerations

**HTML + Alpine.js + TailwindCSS**

- Use Alpine.js for interactive components like:
  - Calendar date picker
  - Time slot selection
  - Form validation
  - Modal dialogs for confirmations

- TailwindCSS for responsive layouts:
  - Mobile-first approach
  - Custom styling for calendar components
  - Consistent color scheme based on business branding

- Component structure:
  - Navigation/header
  - Calendar view (monthly/weekly/daily)
  - Service selection cards
  - Time slot grid
  - Booking form
  - Confirmation screens

- Local storage to save client information for returning users

## 6. Backend Technical Considerations

**Python + Supabase**

- Supabase Authentication for business owner accounts
- Supabase Database for data storage:
  - Set up appropriate tables per the data model
  - Create row-level security policies to protect data
  - Use foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity

- Python backend responsibilities:
  - API endpoints for CRUD operations
  - Business logic for availability calculations
  - Email notification system
  - Data validation

- Key backend functions:
  - Calculate available time slots based on business hours, service duration, and existing appointments
  - Handle time zone conversions for accurate scheduling
  - Generate and send email confirmations/reminders
  - Create simple reports of appointments

- Consider using FastAPI or Flask for your Python backend framework

## Next Steps

1. Start by setting up your Supabase project and database tables
2. Create basic authentication flows for business owners
3. Build a simple business profile management interface
4. Implement the service management functionality
5. Develop the calendar and availability system
6. Add the appointment booking flow for clients
7. Implement notifications and reminders
8. Test thoroughly with sample businesses and appointments
